# Exercise 1
The exercise for this week should be pretty simple and comprises two parts. First, you need to go to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) and create an account. Second, you need to go through the practice of creating a computer instance, connecting to it, opening an IPython interpreter window, and destroying the instance. Both tasks are described below, as well as what you need to submit for each task.

## Create a GitHub.com account
The process for creating a [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) account is straightforward.

1. Open a web browser and navigate to [https://www.github.com](https://www.github.com).
2. On the [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) home page, click on the green **Sign up** button on the top right.

3. Enter a username, email address, and password. Click **Create an account**.
4. When prompted to select a plan, choose the free option. We will provide private repositories through the course account.
5. **Important**: After you have created your account, please send an email to your course instructor with your username. This will allow us to add you to the [course GitHub organization](https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/), which is how much of the course materials will be distributed in the future.

## Use the cloud
Following the instructions you've already used for connecting to a cloud computer, repeat the process. Specifically, you should

1. Create a new computer instance
2. Connect to the new instance
3. Open an IPython interpreter window and run the command `%sx hostname;date`.
4. Copy the output of that command and send it in an email (along with your GitHub.com username) to your course instructor.
5. Destroy the computer instance

This will help you become familiar with the process of using the cloud computers, which we will regularly do in this course.

## What to submit
Please send an email containing (1) your GitHub.com username, and (2) the output of the command you're asked to run in IPython to your course instructor no later than Friday 9.9 at midnight.
