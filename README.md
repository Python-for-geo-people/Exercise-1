# Exercise 1: Creating a GitHub account and using the cloud
The exercise for this week should be pretty simple and comprises two parts. First, you need to go to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) and create an account. Second, you need to go through the practice of creating a computer instance, connecting to it, opening an IPython interpreter window, and destroying the instance. Both tasks are described below, as well as what you need to submit for each task.

## Create a GitHub.com account
The process for creating a [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) account is straightforward.

1. Open a web browser and navigate to [https://www.github.com](https://www.github.com).
2. On the [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) home page, click on the green **Sign up** button on the top right.

3. Enter a username, email address, and password. Click **Create an account**.
4. When prompted to select a plan, choose the free option. We will provide private repositories through the course GitHub organization account.

## Use the cloud
Following the instructions you've already used for connecting to a cloud computer, repeat the process. Specifically, you should

1. [Login on the Pouta Blueprints computing dashboard and create a new computer instance](https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/A-taste-of-Python/blob/master/Background/launch-instance.md)
2. [Connect to the new instance](https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/A-taste-of-Python/blob/master/Background/connect-to-instance.md)
3. [Open an IPython interpreter window](https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/A-taste-of-Python/blob/master/Lesson/A-taste-of-Python.md#getting-started) and run the command that follows by typing it in exactly as shown and pressing **Enter**

    ```python
    %sx hostname; date
    ```
4. Copy and save the output of that command. You will need to send the output to your course instructor via email for this exercise.
5. [Destroy the computer instance](https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/A-taste-of-Python/blob/master/Background/destroy-instance.md)

Going through this process will help you become familiar with using the cloud computer system that we will regularly use in this course.

## What to submit
Your assignment is to send an email to your course instructor containing (1) your GitHub.com username, and (2) the output of the command you're asked to run in IPython. This message should be sent **no later than Friday 9.9 at midnight**.

In case you're curious, we will add you to the [course GitHub organization](https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/) using your GitHub username. Future exercises and course materials will be distributed using your [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) accounts, and your solutions to the exercises will be stored privately in your own GitHub file repositories.
